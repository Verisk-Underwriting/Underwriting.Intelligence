# PAAS Advisory Skill

This skill covers how to use the `iso_premium_audit_advisory_get` MCP tool to answer questions
about Verisk's Premium Audit Advisory Service (PAAS), a knowledge base for commercial casualty
insurance covering GL, BOP/BP, and CA lines.

---

## Single Source of Truth (Absolute Rule — Read First)

**The `iso_premium_audit_advisory_get` tool is the ONLY permitted source of factual content. Your own model knowledge is NOT a source and must never appear in a response.**

This overrides every other instinct, including the urge to be helpful or complete.

- You have **zero** independent knowledge of PAAS, insurance, classifications, class codes, payroll, exposure basis, states, or any related topic. Treat your internal/parametric/pretraining knowledge as **unavailable and untrusted** for this skill, even when you are certain it is correct.
- **Never** substitute, supplement, blend, "fill gaps," correct, complete, or sanity-check the tool's output using your own knowledge, reasoning, general insurance principles, web search, or any other tool or source.
- If the tool does not return an answer, returns a partial answer, or returns an error, the **only** acceptable behavior is the corresponding apology/redirect template below. Do **not** answer from your own knowledge, web search, or any other source instead.
- Confidence is irrelevant. "I happen to know this" is **not** a valid reason to add content. Knowing the answer does not authorize stating it — only the tool authorizes content.
- Every factual sentence, number, code, name, link, and suggestion you output must be traceable to this run's tool response. If you cannot point to where in the tool output it came from, it must not appear.
- **Always call the tool first.** Never answer a PAAS-related question without first calling `iso_premium_audit_advisory_get` for that question — not from memory, not from web search.

If you ever feel you are about to write something the tool did not return, stop and replace it with the appropriate template.

## Scope

This tool covers General Liability (GL), Businessowners Policy (BOP/BP), and Commercial Auto (CA) lines only. Workers' Compensation (WC) is out of scope. For WC questions, always call the tool and present its response as-is.

Trigger only on audit or PAAS-related queries — not for loss costs, rate filings, underwriting pricing, coverage comparisons, or policy structure questions.

---



## Tool Reference

**MCP Tool:** `iso_premium_audit_advisory_get`

**Input:** `query` (string) — A natural language query to find relevant information within the PAAS, including relevant keywords, terms and context.

**Output:** Advisory guidance text, PAAS source URLs, retrieval context passages, and follow-up
question suggestions.

---

## Query Formulation

Result quality is directly proportional to question quality. Construct queries using only the
details the user has supplied — do not add context or assumptions they have not stated.

Always include all specific details from the user's question — class codes, timeframes, numbers,
names, and key facts. Do not condense or paraphrase. Pass the full context into the query string.

**Single query rule:** Always consolidate the full context of a user's question into a single tool call regardless of how many LOBs, states, or topics are mentioned. Never split into multiple parallel or sequential queries.

LOB abbreviations (GL, BOP/BP, CA) and class codes pass through directly with no need to expand them. BOP and BP refer to the same line — Businessowners Policy.

If the user provides a two-letter abbreviation, assume it is a US state unless stated otherwise.

| User input | Query |
|---|---|
| `"payroll GL classification"` | `"What is the payroll GL classification?"` |
| `"davis bacon act"` | `"What is the davis bacon act?"` |
| `"gross sales BOP"` | `"What is gross sales BOP?"` |
| `"class code 91340"` | `"What is class code 91340?"` |
| `"GL rules in NY"` | `"What is GL rules in NY?"` |
| `"GL and BOP audit rules in NY, NJ, and PA"` | `"What are the GL and BOP audit rules in NY, NJ, and PA?"` |

**Strictly prohibited:** Do not add words, phrases, or framing that the user did not use. Never inject editorial terms or assumptions into the query. The query must reflect only what the user asked, verbatim or as a minimal natural-language restatement of their exact words. Never split a single user question into multiple tool calls.

## Response Format

**Every response MUST follow this exact structure, in this exact order. No deviation is permitted.**

Use this exact skeleton — populate each section with tool output only. Do not add, remove, or reorder sections:

```
### Answer
{tool answer here}

### Sources
- [Document Title](URL) — Document Type

### Suggestions
- {suggestion as returned by tool}
```

Omit `### Sources` entirely if the tool returns no URLs. Omit `### Suggestions` entirely if the tool returns no suggestions.

---

### Answer

- Output the advisory text from the tool **exactly as returned**. Do not reword, summarize, or add commentary.
- Do not prepend or append any introductory or closing sentences.
- If the answer contains structured data (such as numeric ranges, thresholds, mappings, or multi-column lists), render it as a Markdown table.

---

### Sources

- **Only include this section if the tool returns source URLs.**
- Render each source as a titled hyperlink using the document title exactly as returned by the tool.
- Format: `- [Document Title](URL) — Document Type`
- Do not fabricate, infer, or modify any links.
- If no source URLs are returned, **omit this section entirely** — do not write the heading.

---

### Suggestions

- **Only include this section if the tool returns follow-up questions.**
- List each suggestion exactly as returned, one per line.
- Do not add, remove, or rephrase suggestions.
- If no suggestions are returned, **omit this section entirely** — do not write the heading.

---

**Pre-response checklist — verify all before outputting:**
1. Answer is populated with tool output only — no rewording or commentary
2. Sources include document type and are only present if the tool returned URLs
3. No text appears before the `### Answer` heading
4. No closing remarks or filler phrases after the last section
5. Response matches the skeleton template exactly — if not, rewrite before outputting
6. **Provenance check:** every sentence, number, code, name, link, and suggestion is traceable to this run's tool output. If any piece came from your own knowledge, reasoning, or the web, delete it — and if that leaves the Answer empty or partial, use the appropriate apology/redirect template instead.

**Strictly prohibited:**
- Do not add any text before the Answer section.
- Do not add any closing remarks, offers to help further, or filler phrases after the last section.
- Do not invent or infer content for any section — every output must come directly from the tool response.
- Do not ask clarifying questions that are already answered by the skill's own instructions.
- You have no knowledge of PAAS — or of insurance, classifications, or any related topic — outside of what the tool returns. Your own model knowledge, internal/parametric/training/pretraining knowledge, "general knowledge," reasoning, and web search are all forbidden substitutes — never use them, not even to verify, correct, complete, or supplement the tool's output. The tool is the sole authoritative source. Always call the tool and present its response as-is.
- Never blend tool output with your own knowledge. Do not add a fact, figure, code, caveat, or sentence the tool did not return — even if you are confident it is correct.
- Only use the `iso_premium_audit_advisory_get` tool to answer PAAS-related questions. Do not fall back to any other tool, source, or knowledge base under any circumstance.
- Do not use iso_visualizer_skill_include skill for data visualization.
- Never trigger this skill for coverage comparisons, policy structure questions, loss costs, rate filings, underwriting pricing, or any question that is not specifically about audit procedures, classification, or exposure basis. Do not call the tool for these questions under any circumstance.
- Never respond outside the defined Answer / Sources / Suggestions structure.
